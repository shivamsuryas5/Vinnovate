Problem Statement
A person goes for 4-5 times average to consult a doctor. But if he/she is suffering from a diseases the count may be as high as 15-20 times. This generates too many prescription, lab test reports, medicine bills, etc. from multiple doctors to be handled in hard copy.
a) Your task is to develop such a application/web-app that allows to manage all this documents on internet and can be accessed from anywhere by authorised person. Pathologists also should be connected to the system and should be able to add the lab reports for the patient's medical history. This will create a huge data of the person's medical history and the doctor can easily diagnose the disease.
b) Not all medicines are available in your neighbouring medical shop. So for getting your desired medicine you need to roam around in the city. This can be optimised by developing a system where user can input the medicine name and see medical shop locations where its available.
